# CommitteeSplitter
This is a simple python script that splits a list of people into groups of a given size.
It is useful for splitting a committee into smaller groups for discussion or other activities.

Hopefully this year the SIGGRAPH Asia committee will be able to use this script to split the committee into smaller groups for discussion.
